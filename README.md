# DAProject
In this study, we use machine learning algorithms such as Decision tree, Logistic regression, KNN, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Neural Network etc. to predict flight prices and flight types based on a flight dataset. The dataset includes information on various flight attributes such as origin and destination airports, airline carriers, flight duration, distance, and flight price. The study's goal is to develop and compare models that can predict flight prices and flight types based on these attributes. The dataset used is called "Travel Dataset", and it is taken from Kaggle.
